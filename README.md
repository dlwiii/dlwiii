2025-12-31 Dec.  The jury is back and Claude Code is the clear winner!  It's doing things like creating and improving an entire internal admin site, helping me with real coding work and client management, even with astrophotography image processing!  Happy to pay $100 a month.  It's not perfect, but not an absolute idiot like the others I've tried.

2025-08-28 Aug - these days I'm trying to get my new Jr Developers to do many dumb repetitive tasks.  Claude is slower, but better than GPT4.1 so far.  But the jury it still out on how to make best use of these dumb, but hard-working oafs.

2024-11 Nov - Working on alot of RPA these days, automating all the damn systems that won't build a decent API.  It is frustrating, but also fun overcoming all the obstacles.
